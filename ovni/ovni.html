    <h1>Washington D.C. Attacked By Flying Saucers</h1>
    <h2>Dateline Washington D.C.</h2>
    <h3>Frank Bragg reporting</h3>
    <p>The country was brought to a standstill today when flying saucers – presumably from Mars, although Venusians have also been suspected – appeared over the nation’s capital, intent on destruction. Curiously, they only attacked Pennsylvania Avenue, and have not appeared elsewhere in the country.
